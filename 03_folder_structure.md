# Folder Structure Guidelines
## üóÑÔ∏è High-level Folder Structure
Here is the high-level folder structure for LookML objects, general object hierarchy can be found [here](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/lookml-terms-and-concepts).

| Folder Name       | Function                                                                          |
| -------------     |:-------------                                                                     |
| **dashboards**    | Houses all LookML dashboards                                                      |
| **explores**      | Houses individual Explore files that will be referred to in models                |
| **models**        | Houses model files that will pick up explores from the explores folder            |
| **views**         | Houses all the view files that will be used in explores, including derived tables |

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Views Folder Structure
Within the views folder, there will be sub-folders and view files that have been set-up to separate each business use-case, allowing developers ease of navigation through the IDE.

| Folder Name               | Function                                                                                      |
| -------------             |:--------------                                                                                |
| **shared_views**          | Houses sub-folders for view files shared across the business, e.g. calendar view              |
| **core**                  | Houses sub-folders for business-wide view files, e.g. orders                                  |
| **marketing**             | Houses sub-folders for marketing-related view files                                           |
| **operations**            | Houses sub-folders for operations-related view files                                          |

*Naturally there will be some overlap between the folders as a view covers more than one area, but the view's primary function should determine its location within the IDE*

----

### Views Sub-folder Structure
Within each sub-folder in the views folder, there will be three sub-folders that refer to the type of development that should take place in the files within the folder.

| Folder Name           | Function                                                                                                                                                  |Naming Convention                 |
| -------------         |:-------------                                                                                                                                             |:-------------                    |
| **auto_generated**    | Houses files as they come when generated by 'Create view from table' - these should be unedited versions of the auto-generated LookML                     |View and file name to match       |
| **refined**           | Houses refinement view files of the core view files, this is where amendments to existing (and the creation of new) field objects can be defined          |File name with suffix `_r`        |
| **advanced**          | Houses refinement view files of the refined view files, this is where more advanced field objects, such as period-on-period fields, can be defined        |File name with suffix `_a`        |
| **derived**           | Houses derived tables including both Ephemeral and Persisted, and both SQL and Native derived tables                                                      |File name with suffix `_dt`       |

*This is a suggested structure and while this method has proven to be efficient, please keep the end-user and other developers in mind when using it, the main outcome should be ease of navigation around the IDE and creation of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code as the instance scales*

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explores Folder Structure
Within the explores folder, there will be sub-folders and explore files that have been set-up to separate each business use-case, allowing developers ease of navigation through the IDE.

| Folder Name               | Function                                                                                         |
| -------------             |:--------------                                                                                   |
| **core**                  | Houses sub-folders for business-wide explore files, e.g. orders                                  |
| **marketing**             | Houses sub-folders for marketing-related explore files                                           |
| **operations**            | Houses sub-folders for operations-r lated explore files                                          |

*In most cases, the explore folder will align with the models*

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Models Folder Strucutre
All model files sit directly within the models folder
